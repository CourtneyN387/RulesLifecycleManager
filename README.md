# RulesLifecycleManager

This project was created during my Software Engineering Internship at Rain and played a crucial role in Rain's decision-making system. Rain's mission revolves around providing access to funds in advance of paychecks, enabling individuals to manage their finances effectively. However, the existing process for updating certain rules related to this system required engineers to go through the production cycle each time.

To address this challenge, I collaborated with another intern to develop the Rules Lifecycle Manager. This full-stack project aimed to simplify the process of managing and updating these rules, streamlining the workflow for engineers. We built the application from scratch using technologies such as Golang for the backend, React for the frontend, and utilized AWS DynamoDB as the database. By leveraging these technologies, we created an intuitive and efficient application that allowed engineers to easily manage and modify the rules governing Rain's lending processes.

## Features and Technologies 
- Rule Management: Easily manage and update rules related to Rain's lending processes
- User-Friendly Interface: Created using React's Chakra package
- Full Stack: Utilizes Golang, React, and AWSDynamoDB
